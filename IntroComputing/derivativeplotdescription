The values of the derivative of signal A with respect to time, with error bars. Although we see that there is a general pattern of the form $y = A\cos{bt}$, as expected for the derivative of a sinusoidal function, there is quite a bit of noise. This is because the noise in the original data is amplified due to the approximation of a curve by taking a straight line between each two adjacent data points. We would see a reduction in noise if we had more data points, as this would gradually approach a continuous, smooth curve.
