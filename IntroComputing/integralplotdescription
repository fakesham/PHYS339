The values of the integral of signal A with respect to time, with error bars. In comparison to the errors on the plot of the derivative, these errors are small, but they appear to grow larger as the time value increases. This is because the interval of time that determined the width of the trapezoid used to approximate each ``slice" of the integral was very small, so the accumulated error was also small.
